    """Construct a kernel launch frame for WebGPU: a grid of workgroups.

    Code inside the launch operates at the workgroup level: ``T.Parallel``,
    ``T.copy`` and friends are mapped onto invocations by the compiler.
    ``T.get_thread_binding()`` exposes the invocation index for thread-level
    code. ``threads`` is recorded at trace time and materialized by the WebGPU
    pipeline once the target is known.

    Parameters
    ----------
    *blocks : int | PrimExpr
        Grid extent along each axis (1-3 dimensions). The launch yields one
        workgroup index per axis.
    threads : int | list[int] | tuple[int, ...], optional
        Invocations per workgroup: a count or up to three per-dimension
        extents. Defaults to 128 when omitted.

    Examples
    --------
    .. code-block:: python

        with T.Kernel(T.ceildiv(N, 128), threads=128) as bx:
            ...
